# Lab 2

**How this document works**

This workshop is primarily driven by the documentation in the Microchip Trust Platform Design Suite located in trust_platform/DesignTools/Docs.  If there is any expansion or localized managed lab correction, it will be written here.

Each major heading section relates to each major section in **trust_platform/DesignTools/Docs/TrustFLEX_guide_custom_PKI_AWS.pdf**.  Locate and open this document.

If you are running these steps in an unmanaged workshop capacity (in your own account) please implement the steps defined in the document **TrustFLEX_guide_AWS_demo_account_setup.pdf** before continuing.  In a managed workshop capacity this step has been done for you.

# 1. Introduction

1. **WINDOWS** To open the Navigator window, click the Windows **Start** icon, locate **Anaconda3 (64-bit)**, and click **Anaconda Navigator (trust_platform)**.
2. **OSX** Launch Anaconda-Navigator from the Application folder.

If you have never used Jupyter notebooks before, please read this section.  Otherwise, move to the next section.

# 2. Jupyter Notebook Tutorials

The two notebooks we will be using in this Lab include:

* TrustFLEX\00_resource_generation\TFLXTLS_resource_generator.ipynb
* TrustFLEX\06_custom_pki_aws\notebook\TFLXTLS_aws_connect.ipynb

# 3. Resource Generation

In this section, you will prepare the device resources for the ECC608A.

1. Connect your kit to your workstation.
   1. Remove the kit from the box.
   2. Connect the USB cable to the computer and then connect the other end of the cable to the kit.
2. Make a serial connection to the kit.  See [Serial Connectivity to Your Device](serial.md) for more details on connecting to the device for your specific operating system.
   1. Press the reset button on the device.  You should see output similar to the following.

      If you do not see this, or see garbage similar to the following,

      ```text
      (APP)(INFO)Chip ID 1503a0
      ```

      you must [Reset the Image to the FACTORY IMAGE](https://microchipdeveloper.com/authentication:cryptoauth-factory-reset).

      **IMPORTANT** click the **ERASE** button prior to **PROGRAM** for best results.  After program, click the reset button on the device once more to ensure you see the expected results in the serial terminal window.

      Otherwise, continue to the next major step.
3. Complete the documentation instruction for Section 3.  Be mindful of the following:
   1. **SKIP THE FIRST BUTTON** that loads in the notebook after running all steps.  You already configured the CLI in Lab 1.  Continue to the next button for generating the resources.

# 4. Use Case Prototyping

3. Follow the steps in section 4.2.2.

**NOTE**: If the output scrolls continuously, ensure that the Wi-Fi credential you have configured in `aws_wifi_task.c` is correct.

Congratulations! You have completed Lab 2!

If you are participating in a managed workshop, please wait until the instructor introduces the next section.
